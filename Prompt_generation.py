conversation_prompt_template ="""
You are an expert AI prompt engineer specializing in creating realistic, logically connected **multi-turn conversation prompts** to evaluate an LLM’s reasoning depth.

---
### Input
**Functional Requirement Text:**
{requirements}

**Category:**
{category}

**Subcategory:**
{subcategory}

---
### Objective
Generate a conversation that simulates a **natural, progressive dialogue** between a human evaluator and an LLM.  
Each follow-up question **must logically depend** on the previous **answer**, exploring deeper nuances or implications of that answer.

---
### Rules
1. Start with a **broad introductory question** directly tied to the requirement.
2. After each answer, imagine how a human would naturally ask a **follow-up** question that digs deeper into:
   - A term or concept mentioned in the LLM’s previous answer.
   - A scenario, limitation, or implication raised by the previous response.
3. Maintain **strong contextual continuity** — every question should make sense only if the previous answer existed.
4. Include exactly **5 rounds** of Q&A.
5. Provide the output strictly as a Markdown table with columns:

| Category | Subcategory | Conversation Step | Question | Assumed LLM Answer |

6. Ensure:
   - Step 1 introduces the topic clearly.
   - Step 2 clarifies or explores a detail from Step 1’s answer.
   - Step 3 compares or challenges a concept from Step 2.
   - Step 4 deepens with an exception, risk, or limitation.
   - Step 5 concludes with a reflective or strategic insight.
7. Maintain **realistic conversational flow** — avoid topic jumps.
8. Keep responses short but rich in explanation.
9. Do not include meta text, notes, or explanations outside the table.

---
### Example Format

| Conversation Step | Question | Assumed LLM Answer |
|------------------|-----------|--------------------|
| 1 | Can you explain the primary difference between comprehensive major medical plans and critical illness plans? | Comprehensive plans pay providers for actual medical expenses; critical illness plans pay a fixed cash amount upon diagnosis. |
| 2 | Since the cash benefit isn’t linked to bills, how do people usually use it? | Typically to cover lost income or non-medical expenses like rent or travel for treatment. |
| 3 | So, would someone benefit from having both types of plans? | Yes, they are complementary—one covers medical costs, the other helps with financial gaps. |
| 4 | You mentioned “pre-defined illnesses.” What happens if an illness isn’t on that list? | The plan won’t pay; coverage is restricted to explicitly listed conditions. |
| 5 | Given those restrictions, how does underwriting differ from major medical plans? | Critical illness plans involve full medical underwriting, unlike guaranteed-issue comprehensive plans. |

---
### Task
Based on the input requirement, generate a **contextually coherent 5-turn conversation** following the above pattern.
"""

prompt_template = """You are an expert Prompt Engineer tasked with generating **validation question prompts** to thoroughly test an LLM chatbot that has been fed the provided requirement document(s).

OBJECTIVE:
For the given **Category** and **Subcategory** (extracted from the requirements), generate a comprehensive, diverse set of user-style questions that another team can feed to the LLM to validate its knowledge, behavior, robustness, and boundaries. Your job is to produce many realistic variations across multiple question types so the LLM can be validated in all possible ways.

--- 
### Input (placeholders)
**Functional Requirement Text:**  
{requirements}

**Category:**  
{category}

**Subcategory:**  
{subcategory}

(Optional) **Additional context / examples:**  
{context}

--- 
### Question Types (must be covered — produce variations for each)
- Comparisons
- Scenario-based
- Compute/Quantify (Compute for X)
- Dynamic Info / Time-bound
- Factual
- Client-related (personalized/clarifying)
- Clarification / Follow-up prompts
- Out-of-scope (should be identified as outside KB)
- Ambiguous / Confusing phrasing (to test robustness)
- Multi-turn / Conversation-flow prompts
- Negative tests (malformed input, contradictory facts)
- Localization / Region-specific variations
- Safety / Sensitive content checks (if applicable)
- Edge-case / Rare-event questions

--- 
### Strict Instructions (Behavioral rules)
1. **Understand first:** Fully read the `requirements` and build a clear mental model of the feature, domain, and constraints before generating questions. Use any named entities, constraints, thresholds, or example scenarios found in the requirements to make questions realistic and contextual.
2. **One row per question:** Return each generated question as one row in the required Markdown table (see Output Format).
3. **Diversity & variations:** For each Question Type above generate **multiple distinct variations** (paraphrases, short/long forms, formal/informal tone) — at least **5 unique questions per Question Type**, unless the type is clearly irrelevant to the given Category/Subcategory (if irrelevant, output zero rows for that type but list the reason in the internal rationale — do NOT output the rationale in the final table).
4. **Multi-turn & follow-ups:** For at least some scenario-based and factual questions, include follow-up questions that a user might ask after receiving an LLM response (format each follow-up as a separate question row).
5. **Out-of-scope checks:** Produce explicit out-of-scope questions (e.g., requests requiring PHI/external APIs/real-time location) that should cause the LLM to refuse politely or indicate it lacks that data.
6. **Ambiguity & traps:** Include ambiguous or intentionally misleading phrasings to verify the LLM asks clarifying questions rather than hallucinating answers.
7. **Compute & numeric verification:** For "Compute/Quantify" type, generate questions that require simple arithmetic or threshold checks using values from requirements (or realistic sample values if none exist).
8. **Localization & units:** Provide regional/unit variations (e.g., metric vs imperial, currency formats) where applicable.
9. **Tone & role variations:** Include prompts phrased as end-users, domain experts, auditors, and casual users to test differing expectations.
10. **Safety & policy checks:** Add a few prompts that test model's handling of sensitive, illegal, or disallowed requests—these should be labeled as Out-of-scope or Safety checks.
11. **Answer expectation hints (internal only):** Do not include this in the output table — but generate questions that clearly reveal if the LLM's reply is correct or not (e.g., ask for a specific field or value found in the requirements).
12. **No explanations in output:** The final output must contain only the Markdown table rows — no extra commentary, no diagnostics, no internal rationale, and no code fences.

--- 
### Output Format (STRICT — no extra text)
Return **only** a Markdown table with EXACT columns and header below (no prelude, no trailing text):

| Question Type | Category | Subcategory | Question |
|---------------|----------|-------------|----------|
| <Question Type> | <Category> | <SubCategory> | <Full user question text> |
| ... | ... | ... | ... |

- Each cell must be a plain string.  
- Preserve punctuation and quotation marks inside the Question cell.  
- Do not output additional columns.  
- If a question contains multiple parts, keep them in the same Question cell separated by a newline or semicolon.

--- 
### Example row (for reference only — do NOT include extra text outside the table):
| Comparisons | Vandalism | Weather Condition | What was the weather like during the incident? Describe the road condition. |

--- 
### Task
Using the `requirements`, `category`, and `subcategory` create a **large, diverse list** of question prompts (as specified above). Output them strictly in the Markdown table format requested. Begin now.

category_prompt = """
You are an expert business analyst specializing in requirement classification.

You are given a document containing system or process requirements.

Your task:
1. Carefully read the provided requirements text.
2. Identify the **main functional areas** or **themes** — these are the **Categories**.
3. For each Category, identify 2–4 **specific topics or aspects** within it — these are the **Subcategories**.
4. Do not invent unrelated categories. Ensure that every category and subcategory is derived from the actual requirement content.

Output format (very important):
Provide the result strictly as a Markdown table with the headers:
| Category | Subcategory |

Example output:
| Category | Subcategory |
|-----------|--------------|
| Demand Management | Planning |
| Demand Management | Variability |
| Forecasting | Accuracy |
| Forecasting | Methods |
| Inventory Management | Levels |
| Inventory Management | Optimization |

Guidelines:
- Keep category names concise (2–4 words).
- Avoid repetition.
- Focus on logical grouping (e.g., if requirements mention demand forecasting, production scheduling, supplier lead time, treat those as separate categories).
- Include at least 5–10 total category–subcategory pairs.
- Do not include explanations, reasoning, or extra text outside the Markdown table.

Now extract the Category and Subcategory pairs from the following requirements:
