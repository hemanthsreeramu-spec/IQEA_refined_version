        "prompt_text": """You are a skilled XPath expert.

Given the following list of HTML or SVG elements from a Power BI report, generate robust XPath expressions for each element. Follow these guidelines:
Generate XPath expressions for each of the following HTML elements, ensuring to cover all relevant attributes like tag, class, id, and text. Provide XPath expressions for elements based on these attributes. Handle cases where there are multiple elements with the same class or text by incorporating appropriate unique identifiers. The attributes in the input may vary for different tags and should be handled accordingly.
### General Rules:
- For each element in the input list:
  - Ensure every element has a generated XPath, even if the text is empty.
  - For each element, provide a clear, readable description and a robust XPath expression
- For elements with text:
  - If text is nested, always use:
    `//*[contains(@class, '...')]//*[contains(text(), '...')]`.
  - Avoid `and` conditions for text matching.
  - Ensure text matches are flexible with `contains()`.

- For elements with class names but without text:
  - Use `//*[contains(@class, '...')]` to match elements.
  - For any nested elements, use `//*` to capture all.

- The XPath should be as specific and flexible as possible, accommodating both HTML and SVG contexts.

### Special Rules for Graph Elements:
- For labels within graphs:
  `//*[contains(@class,'cartesianChart')]//*[@class='label-container']//*[contains(text(), '...')]`

- For axis ticks in graphs:
  `//*[contains(@class,'cartesianChart')]//child::*[@class='tick']//*[contains(text(), '...')]`

- For graph titles:
  `//*[contains(@class,'cartesianChart')]//following::*[contains(@class,'visualTitle')]//*[contains(text(), '...')]`

### Additional Handling:
- If an element is a `visual-container` with text, always use:
  `//*[contains(@class,'visual-container')]//*[contains(text(), '...')]`
- For SVG text, use:
  `//*[name()='svg']//*[contains(text(), '...')]`.

3. (Optional) Recorded User Actions:

Instructions:
1. Fully implement each test case from start to end — no step should be skipped.
2. For each step:
   - First, check if a matching method exists in the page object file and use it.
   - If no method exists, check for a matching XPath locator and use `driver.find_element(...)`.
   - If neither exists, use a direct Selenium command based on visible text or inferred intent.
   - If `Recorded User Actions` is provided, align actions with the test case flow to improve accuracy or fill in any missing interactions.
3. Include assert statements to validate expected outcomes as per each step.
4. Follow the step order exactly as defined in the test case.
5. Extract reusable flows (e.g., login) as helper methods inside the test file.
6. Use pytest structure: imports, fixtures, and one test function per test case.
7. Add inline comments that clearly describe the purpose of each step (based on the test case or recorded actions).
8. Output only valid Python test code — no explanations, no markdown formatting, and no extra content.
