End of summary.: UI field names, labels, validation rules, page content.

Task: Generate end-to-end test cases from the provided action flow.
Objective:
Each test case = one complete user journey (positive or negative, not mixed).
Cover all major workflows:
Login
Inventory
Cart
Checkout
logout
Granularity Rules:
Test Case Granularity: Each scenario type (positive/negative) = separate test case.
Include full navigation and data entry from start to finish.
Test Step Granularity: Each user action = one step (click, type, select, switch).
Break navigation into individual clicks (e.g., "Click 'About Us'" → "Click 'Leadership'").
Each form field input = separate step.
Order & Coverage: Follow the exact chronological order of the provided action file.
Do not skip or reorder steps.
Ensure all scenarios are covered.: user stories, acceptance criteria, business rules.

Mandatory Rules:

1. Generate exactly 20 unique test cases that cover all flows, pages, actions, clicks, and form fields present in action_data_processed. Do not omit any step, intermediate click, or input.

2. Each Test Case must represent one complete user journey (positive or negative).
   - Example: One test case for successful form submission, another for negative validations.
   - Do not mix positive and negative scenarios in the same test case.

Step Writing Style & URL Rules:

- Steps must be human-readable and executable by a manual tester.
- Do not explicitly mention page names; derive context from action_data_processed.
- Use these patterns for actions:
    - Launch the application and open <URL> ← only for the first action on a page.
    - Click on "<UI label>" ← if the click changes the URL, include the new URL in the expected result; otherwise, omit URL.
    - Enter "<value>" in "<field>" field ← no URL needed.
    - Select "<option>" from "<dropdown>" ← no URL needed.
    - Verify visibility of "<fields/sections>" ← no URL needed.
    - Switch to window with URL "<URL>" ← include URL when switching windows.
- Every navigation and intermediate step must be included — no shortcuts.
- For validation steps:
    - Leave "<field>" empty and click "<button>" → Expect validation error message
    - Enter "<invalid value>" in "<field>" → Expect validation error message

Test Case Naming:

- Use sequential unique names: TC01 - <title> to TC20 - <title>.
- Keep titles short and descriptive.

Expected Results:

- Every input, click, or submission must have a clear expected result.
- Validation failures must show the exact error text if available; otherwise, describe the expected error clearly.

Coverage:

- Cover all flows, pages, actions, and form fields present in action_data_processed.
- Each form field must have at least one positive and one negative validation across the suite.
- Include navigation, content verification, and boundary conditions.

Output Format:

- A single Markdown table with this exact header:
  | Test Case Name | Step Number | Test Step Description | Test Step Expected Result | Status | Type | Category
- Category can be Positive, Negative, Workflow, Edge case, UI, etc..
- Write the Category only in Step 0 (the prerequisite/background step). Leave it blank
- Status = New; Type = Manual for every row;
- Step numbers restart for each test case (0,1,2,…). Step 0 = Prerequisite/Background.
- Each test case must have at least 6 steps.

Strict Constraint:

- Do not truncate, summarize, or insert placeholders like “[continued]”.
- Generate the full table with exactly 20 test cases, each fully written out.
- Follow the step style strictly (plain actions, human-readable, no “page — field — action” format).
- Ensure every scenario from the provided action file is captured exactly; do not miss any page, click, form, or intermediate interaction."""
